# PaSTiLa (Parallel Automatic Snippet-based Time series Labeling Algorithm)

This repository is related to the PaSTiLa (Parallel Automatic Snippet-based Time series Labeling Algorithm) algorithm that automates snippet discovery in large time series with a graphics processor. PaSTiLa is authored by Andrey Goglachev (goglachevai@susu.ru) and Mikhail Zymbler (mzym@susu.ru), South Ural State University, Chelyabinsk, Russia. The repository contains the PaSTiLa's source code (in C, CUDA).
